	About this page:

	This Homepage is about Digimon, an IP similar to Pokemon that I cherish dearly. It is populated with some digimon I love wholeheartedly, each of them ripped directly from Digimon World: Dusk / Dawn from the Nintendo DS. I have the classic Digimon title fixed in the top left of the screen alongside a general title for the page. I am using three wallpapers that give a classic 90's feel, and hoped to push it further by having font on the more generic end (Helvetica) on top of the busy pattern designs. I added the construction joke as a light cultural nod to how almost every personal site back in the day had their own "Under Construction" situation. I also added an infamous Animation Factory gif to my site as a nod to the rampant specific gif culture of yesteryear. It is also an intentional design choice for the left side to feel blocky while the right side is open and slightly offcentered in the space it is allotted. Lastly, the reflection effect in the website title is simply there to be extra.

	AI code was not utilized within the constraints of this assignment, and neither were there any tutorials that were utilized. Outside of a rough web layout sketch, I winged everything purposefully to give that authentically scratchy homemade personal style of what happens when all you have is a good 'ole family PC and a dream in the late 90's. That was certainly how I felt when making this site at least!

	It is evident that my website does not currently have a functional webring embed. I had an excused absence the prior week, and a webring request had been submitted by time of submission. However, the first request did not have "final" in the URL, so a second request has been made.
